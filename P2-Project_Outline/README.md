## Submission Instructions

### Overview
	Pet Life is an application that will allow pet owners, vets, and pet sitters access to pets' information at a glance. The pet owner will create a profile for the pet that will include a biography, medical history, and overall any pertinent information for this pet. The Biography page shows the name, age, gender, species, breed, and behavior. The pet owner's profile page includes the pet owner's name and address email. The medical page will show current and past medication, shot records, current or past diseases, and previous surgeries. 

	The pet's history will be helpful to the pet owner as all the information will be in one spot. The pet owner, vets, and pet sitters will be able to add updates. The idea arose because the pet's information is primarily located at the vet's office without a way to transfer the information to another vet or sitter.
### Features
User Login - The user will have secure login and different access depending on if is a pet owner, vet, or pet sitter.
Create Post-  The user will be able to create a post/update for the pet profile.
Highlight Text- This red warning text at the top of the page will show if the animal is venomous or has a behavioral issue.
Search- User will be able to search for given words to find information faster.
### Technologies
The languages and technologies to create Pet Life would be Java, Spring Boot framework,  Thymeleaf templates, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
### What I'll Have to Learn
The pet finder application will use a fun public API to display animal pictures and JavaScript to make the front end more interactive. Forms to enter the information such as a profile, biography, and medical history will require buttons to submit the forms. JavaScript will come in handy to accomplish the interactive features.
